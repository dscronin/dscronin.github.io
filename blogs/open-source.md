title: What is Open Source GIScience?
---

Reflection on readings regarding Open Source GIScience for Friday, February 26. 

  The concept of Open Source GIS is a much more complex and nuanced topic that I had initially imagined. I understood Open Source to simply mean software that is free for users to utilize. The papers by Rey (2009) and Singleton et al. (2016) began to illuminate finer distinctions within the open source movement. The first essential detail is the level of freedom associated with a particular product. Some platforms are free to use, but the user is unable to access the source code. This is what Rey considers the “free beer” definition. In contrast, other platforms are more open source, allowing free use, but also the freedom to access, append or modify the underlying code. This is what Rey considers more analogous to “free speech.” The implication is that many platforms are free to use (ex. Google Earth Engine) but not necessarily truly open source. 
  Stepping outside the realm of propriety software presents new opportunities but also its own challenges, especially in an academic context. Typically in undergraduate institutions like Middlebury an instructor would advise how to accomplish certain GIS methods within a commercial product like ESRI’s ArcGIS. These programs utilize a graphic interface which users can easily click through and complete analysis. Using an open source platform may require students to create or modify code. This is likely a challenge for the majority of students who are unfamiliar with coding. However, there are also clear benefits. Open source platforms enable students to continue to use their skills from school after graduation without an expensive license. Additionally, it may promote better depth of understanding than using a GUI. 
  One of the major benefits of open source GIS is the promotion of collaboration and innovation. I imagine new solutions and methods can be developed much more easily and quickly on open source platforms than by traditional software companies. It allows anyone with technical knowledge to share their work and contribute. This creates more opportunity for people outside of traditional academic or government networks.
  I am looking forward to this experiment in open source GIS. As a class I think we will have to consciously develop a system to give credit to each other when we undoubtedly collaborate. We should make efforts to share openly with each other and recognize that our collective successes and creativity benefit us all.
